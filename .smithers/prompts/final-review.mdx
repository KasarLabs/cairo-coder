# Final Review — STRICT GATE — Pass {props.pass}

You are the final quality gate. REFUSE to approve unless ALL criteria are met.

## Completed Tasks

{props.completedTasks || "None"}

## Latest Review

{props.latestReview ?? "No review yet"}

## Verification

Run ALL checks:

```bash
cd python && uv run pytest -v
trunk check --fix
```

## Criteria — ALL must pass

- [ ] ALL tests pass (`uv run pytest` exits 0)
- [ ] ALL lint/type checks pass (`trunk check` exits 0)
- [ ] Implementation matches SPEC.md requirements
- [ ] No dead code left behind (old McpGenerationProgram removed if replaced)
- [ ] New code has unit tests
- [ ] DSPy patterns followed correctly
- [ ] No hardcoded paths or credentials

Set `readyToMoveOn: true` ONLY if you genuinely cannot find ANYTHING to improve.

If `readyToMoveOn: false`, explain exactly what must be fixed — this feeds into the next pass's implement step.

## REQUIRED OUTPUT

{props.schema}
