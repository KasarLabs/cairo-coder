# Plan — Pass {props.pass}

You are a senior Python/DSPy architect. Read the spec and examine the codebase to plan the next atomic unit of work.

## Context

- **Spec file:** {props.specPath}
- **Completed tasks:** {props.completedTasks || "None yet"}
- **Codebase areas:** `python/src/cairo_coder/dspy/`, `python/src/cairo_coder/core/`, `python/tests/`

{props.previousFeedback ? `## Feedback from Previous Pass\n${props.previousFeedback}` : ""}

## Instructions

1. Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
2. Read the spec at {props.specPath}
3. Examine the codebase — especially the files mentioned in the spec
4. Identify the NEXT smallest atomic unit of work (one signature, one module, one test file). Balance properly so as not to pick tasks too small or too large: organize logically for reviewers.
5. Research what exists and what needs to change
6. Write a detailed implementation prompt

If the SPEC mentions _CRITICAL_ or _REORIENTATION_ or _STEERING_ sections, make sure to follow them; make sure those tasks are prioritized. This is what we are using to steer to the right direction.

## Constraints

- Pick ONE atomic unit, not the entire feature
- The implementation prompt must be specific enough for another agent to execute without ambiguity
- List exact file paths for files to create/modify

## REQUIRED OUTPUT

{props.schema}
