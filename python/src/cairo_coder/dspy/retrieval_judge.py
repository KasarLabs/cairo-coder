    Goal
    ----
    Given a user query and a single technical resource (content + minimal metadata),
    judge how useful the resource is for answering the query.

    How to read inputs
    ------------------
    - query: what the user needs. Extract the main intent (task / concept / error) and key entities
      (e.g., Cairo, Starknet, snforge/sncast/scarb tools, contracts, paymaster, fees, S-Two, STARK Proofs, etc.).
    - system_resource: the resource text.

    Definitions
    -----------
    DIRECTLY RELEVANT: Explains or solves the exact thing asked (same feature/API/version/tool/error/code/concept),
    or provides working code/templates/tests that can be applied immediately.
    CONTEXTUALLY USEFUL: Not a direct answer but gives correct background, patterns, or adjacent
    details that help (e.g., components used by ERC-20/721, Cairo syntax needed for the task,
    Starknet lifecycle when the query is about confirmations, etc.).
    NOT USEFUL:stale/obsolete, unrelated topic, not related to the query.

    Decision rubric (apply in order)
    --------------------------------
    1) Match: Does the resource target the same task/concept/error/tool? (yes/no/partial)
    2) Specificity: Does it include concrete API names, code, commands, flags, fields, or examples that can be used?
    3) Coverage: Does it cover key sub-questions implied by the query (e.g., security, fees, lifecycle, types)?

    Scoring anchors (pick the closest; interpolate if needed)
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    1.00  Exact how-to / spec / error-fix / code sample for this query & correct version Can be directly leveraged to answer the query.
    0.75  Mostly on-point with usable details; may miss a minor part or be slightly tangent but still useful.
    0.50  Indirect context that helps learning or setup, not a direct answer.
    0.25  Weakly related mention(s); very little actionable value.
    0.00  Unrelated or misleading.

    Cairo/Starknet notes (apply silently)
    -------------------------------------
    - Code/templates/tests are always useful if they can be adapted (even if not the exact contract).
    - Prefer resources mentioning: snforge, sncast, scarb, Starknet tx structure/lifecycle, paymaster,
      account abstraction, fees, ABI/Sierra/Casm, common components (ERC20/721), and Cairo core libs.

    Examples (style only; do not copy text)
    ---------------------------------------
    - Query: “explain paymaster on Starknet tx”
      Good reasoning: “Resource <Paymaster spec 0.14>: details the paymaster flow and required fields in the
      tx payload with examples, matching Starknet ≥0.14 — directly answers.” → 0.90–1.00
    - Query: “Explain saturating_sub”
      Good reasoning: “Resource <Cairo core arithmetic>: documents `saturating_sub` with examples; directly answers.” → 1.00
    - Query: “ERC721 policy token on Starknet”
      Context reasoning: “Resource <Components in Cairo>: explains components/modularity used when composing
      ERC721; helpful context but not full implementation.” → ~0.50
    - Query: “fees structure in Starknet”
      Not useful: “Resource <General L1 gas primer>: EVM-only overview; no Starknet specifics.” → 0.00–0.25
    - QUERY: "How to write a S-Two AIR"
      Context reasoning: "Resource <Mersenne Prime>: explains what the Mersenne Prime is and how it's used in S-Two” → ~0.50
    """

    query: str = dspy.InputField()
    system_resource: str = dspy.InputField(
        desc="Single resource text (content + minimal metadata/title)"
    )
    reasoning: str = dspy.OutputField(
