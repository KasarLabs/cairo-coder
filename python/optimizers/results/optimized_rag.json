For immutable variables, it's simply `let variable_name = value;`. For mutable variables, it's `let mut variable_name = value;`.\n3.  **Apply the fix**: To declare `x` and initialize it with `5`, the line should be `let x = 5;`.\n4.  **Verify `println!` usage**: The `println!(\" x is {}\", x)` syntax is correct for Cairo's `println!` macro, which is part of the core library and used for printing formatted output to the console.\n5.  **Formulate the complete, corrected code**:\n    ```cairo\n    \/\/ Make me compile!\n\n    \/\/ I AM NOT DONE\n\n    fn main() {\n        let x = 5; \/\/ Added 'let' keyword\n        println!(\" x is {}\", x);\n    }\n    ```\nThis approach directly addresses the missing keyword, ensuring the variable `x` is properly declared according to Cairo's syntax rules, thus allowing the code to compile and execute as intended.",

Understanding the `maybe_icecream` function requirements:**\n*   The function `maybe_icecream` takes a `usize` `time_of_day` (24-hour system) as input.\n*   It should return an `Option<usize>`, representing the number of ice creams left.\n*   **Logic:**\n    *   If `time_of_day` is invalid (greater than 23), it should return `Option::None`. This handles the \"gracefully handle cases where time_of_day > 23\" requirement.\n    *   If `time_of_day` is before 10 PM (i.e., `time_of_day < 22`), there are 5 pieces left, so it should return `Option::Some(5)`.\n    *   If `time_of_day` is 10 PM (22) or later (23), someone eats them all, so there are 0 pieces left. It should return `Option::Some(0)`.\n\n**2. Implementing `maybe_icecream`:**\nI will use `if-else if-else` statements to implement the conditional logic, checking the invalid time first, then the \"before 10 PM\" condition, and finally the \"10 PM or later\" condition.\n\n```cairo\nfn maybe_icecream(\n    time_of_day: usize\n) -> Option<usize> {\n    if time_of_day > 23 {\n        \/\/ Handle invalid time: return None\n        Option::None\n    } else if time_of_day < 22 {\n        \/\/ Before 10 PM: 5 pieces left\n        Option::Some(5)\n    } else {\n        \/\/ 10 PM or later (22 or 23): 0 pieces left\n        Option::Some(0)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**3. Fixing the `raw_value` test:**\n*   The `raw_value` test has `let icecreams = maybe_icecream(12);`. This means `icecreams` is of type `Option<usize>`.\n*   The assertion `assert(icecreams == 5, 'err_6');` is incorrect because you cannot directly compare an `Option<usize>` with a `usize`.\n*   To access the inner value of an `Option` when you are certain it contains a `Some` value, you can use the `unwrap()` method. Since `maybe_icecream(12)` should return `Some(5)`, `unwrap()` is safe here.\n*   Alternatively, one could use pattern matching (`match icecreams { Some(val) => assert(val == 5, 'err_6'), None => panic_with_felt252('Expected Some value') }`), but `unwrap()` is simpler for this specific test case where we expect a `Some` value.\n\n**4.

In Cairo,\nwhen an argument is passed to a function and it's not explicitly returned,\nyou can't use the original variable anymore. We call this \"moving\" a variable.\nVariables that are moved into a function (or block scope) and aren't explicitly\nreturned get \"dropped\" at the end of that function. This is also what happens here.\nThere's a few ways to fix this, try them all if you want:\n1. Make another, separate version of the data that's in `arr0` and pass that\n   to `fill_arr` instead.\n2. Make `fill_arr` *mutably* borrow a reference to its argument (which will need to be\n   mutable) with the `ref` keyword , modify it directly, then not return anything. Then you can get rid\n   of `arr1` entirely -- note that this will change what gets printed by the\n   first `print`\n3. Make `fill_arr` borrow an immutable view of its argument instead of taking ownership by using the snapshot operator `@`,\n   and then copy the data within the function in order to return an owned\n   `Array<felt>`. This requires an explicit clone of the array and should generally be avoided in Cairo, as the memory is write-once and cloning can be expensive. To clone an object, you will need to import the trait `clone::Clone` and the implementation of the Clone trait for the array located in `array::ArrayTCloneImpl`",
