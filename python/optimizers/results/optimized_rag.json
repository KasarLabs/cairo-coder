      "instructions": "Analyze a Cairo programming query (focused on the Cairo language, Starknet smart contracts, testing with Starknet Foundry, or related blockchain development on Starknet, including client-side interactions via SDKs like starknet.js) to extract relevant search terms and identify appropriate documentation sources. The goal is to generate search queries that can retrieve factual context, documentation, traits, syscalls, examples, and patterns to inform or assist in resolving the query without providing code. Prioritize coverage of core elements like integer types (e.g., i128 exists as a signed integer, but i129 does not; use Into/TryInto traits for conversions between i128, u128, felt252, and handling u256 as two felts in serialization), storage management (e.g., structs with Serde/Store derives, maps/vectors), events, ABIs, syscalls (e.g., get_block_timestamp for timeouts, contract interactions via dispatchers like ERC20Dispatcher), token interfaces (e.g., ERC20 from OpenZeppelin Cairo), proofs/verification (e.g., signatures or Merkle proofs, with traits from corelib), contract patterns (e.g., upgradeability, locking/claiming/refunding funds, authorized callers), testing (e.g., #[should_panic] attributes in Cairo tests, cheatcode functions like start_cheat_caller_address and stop_cheat_caller_address in Starknet Foundry, handling reverts on invalid inputs like zero prices), and Starknet protocol details (e.g., transaction versions like V3 invoke transactions with resource bounds, nonce management for validity, mempool time-to-live (TTL) of 5 minutes, no inherent timestamp fields in V3 transactions but signature validity tied to nonce and TTL, network testnets like Sepolia). For client-side queries (e.g., TypeScript interactions), target SDK-specific details like starknet.js v7 for V3 transaction formats, argument serialization (e.g., ContractAddress and u256 handling), and authorization. Ignore non-Cairo/Starknet queries or vague/non-specific inputs (e.g., foreign language without Cairo context), generating minimal or empty outputs with a note if the query is off-topic.\n\nInput format:\n- \"query\": A string containing the user's question or task description, possibly including code snippets for context (analyze but do not output or execute code; focus on patterns like test assertions failing due to expected panics or contract reverts).\n- \"chat_history\": A string summarizing prior conversation or \"None\" if no history (e.g., incorporate context like previous discussions on test corrections or panic handling).\n\nStrategy:\n1. Break down the query into key components: language features (types, traits, conversions, attributes like #[should_panic]), Starknet specifics (contracts, storage, events, syscalls, interactions, protocol rules like transaction TTL, nonces, V3 formats, resource bounds), testing (Starknet Foundry cheats, panic/revert validation), application logic (e.g., remittances with timeouts, token transfers, authorized function calls), and client-side aspects (e.g., SDK invocations, argument passing, network specifics like Sepolia).\n2. Generate 3-10 targeted search queries as a list of strings, focusing on precise terms to fetch relevant docs or examples (e.g., \"cairo i128 to felt252 conversion example\" for practical usage; \"Cairo get_block_timestamp syscall\" for timeouts; \"starknet.js v7 invoke contract V3 TypeScript example\" or \"starknet.js resource bounds Sepolia\" for client-side; \"Starknet v3 transaction fields nonce TTL\" or \"Starknet invoke transaction signature validity over time\" for protocol details; \"cairo #[should_panic] attribute test example\" or \"starknet foundry cheat caller address\" for testing; avoid overly broad or app-specific queries like \"remittance platform\" that yield few results—instead target primitives like \"Starknet contract storage maps\" or \"Cairo event emission examples\"; ensure queries address version-specific behaviors (e.g., v3 transactions) and serialization details (e.g., u256 as two felts)).\n3. Identify 3-5 relevant documentation resources from this prioritized list, selecting based on query needs and ensuring coverage for testing/client-side gaps:\n   - 'cairo_book': For core language features, structs, enums, syscalls, traits, attributes like #[should_panic].\n   - 'corelib_docs': For detailed implementations like integer types, conversions (Into/TryInto), serialization, traits in proofs/timestamps/signatures.\n   - 'cairo_by_example': For practical code snippets, patterns (e.g., storage, events, conversions, test setups).\n   - 'starknet_docs': For contract deployment, interactions, block info, ABIs, dispatchers, protocol rules (e.g., transaction V3 formats, nonces, TTL, mempools, no timestamps in transactions).\n   - 'openzeppelin_docs': For ERC20/ERC721 interfaces, token handling, security patterns (e.g., access control for authorized callers).\n   - 'scarb_docs': For build tools, but only if query involves compilation/deployment.\n   - 'starknet_foundry': For testing specifics (e.g., cheatcodes, panic handling, test assertions on reverts).\n   Add notes in feedback if a resource fills gaps (e.g., corelib_docs for traits in proofs/timestamps; starknet_docs for V3 transaction validity and TTL details; starknet_foundry for test corrections involving panics or cheats). If the query involves client-side SDKs like starknet.js, note the limitation of available resources (e.g., \"starknet_docs covers protocol but not SDK implementation; suggest external starknet.js docs for TypeScript examples\") and prioritize queries that could retrieve SDK context indirectly via starknet_docs mentions of SDKs.\n\nOutput format (structured as YAML-like sections, no code, no full analysis text—only the lists and notes where specified):\n### search_queries\n['query1', 'query2', ...]  # List of concise, targeted strings\n\n### resources\n['resource1', 'resource2', ...]  # List of strings from the above options\n\nIf the query is not Cairo/Starknet-related or too vague, output empty lists and a brief note: \"Query not specific to Cairo/Starknet; no relevant searches or resources generated.\"",

In Cairo,\nwhen an argument is passed to a function and it's not explicitly returned,\nyou can't use the original variable anymore. We call this \"moving\" a variable.\nVariables that are moved into a function (or block scope) and aren't explicitly\nreturned get \"dropped\" at the end of that function. This is also what happens here.\nThere's a few ways to fix this, try them all if you want:\n1. Make another, separate version of the data that's in `arr0` and pass that\n   to `fill_arr` instead.\n2. Make `fill_arr` *mutably* borrow a reference to its argument (which will need to be\n   mutable) with the `ref` keyword , modify it directly, then not return anything. Then you can get rid\n   of `arr1` entirely -- note that this will change what gets printed by the\n   first `print`\n3. Make `fill_arr` borrow an immutable view of its argument instead of taking ownership by using the snapshot operator `@`,\n   and then copy the data within the function in order to return an owned\n   `Array<felt>`. This requires an explicit clone of the array and should generally be avoided in Cairo, as the memory is write-once and cloning can be expensive. To clone an object, you will need to import the trait `clone::Clone` and the implementation of the Clone trait for the array located in `array::ArrayTCloneImpl`",

For instance, `ByteArrayTrait::append` is defined as `fn append(ref self: ByteArray, other: ByteArray)`.\n\nIn Cairo, function parameters are immutable by default. To allow modifications to a parameter within the function, it must be declared as `mut`. The hint explicitly guides towards adding `mut` to an existing binding.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to change the `arr` parameter in the `fill_arr` function signature from an immutable binding to a mutable one.\n\nOriginal: `fn fill_arr(arr: Array<felt252>) -> Array<felt252>`\nChange to: `fn fill_arr(mut arr: Array<felt252>) -> Array<felt252>`\n\nThis single change makes the `arr` variable mutable within the `fill_arr` function, allowing `arr.append()` calls to succeed.",

Your primary task is to complete provided Cairo code snippets, specifically addressing all `\/\/ TODO:` sections, ensuring the modified code passes all associated tests.\n\nFor each query, you will receive:\n- `Query`: The Cairo code containing `\/\/ TODO:` markers.\n- `Hint`: A suggestion or specific guidance for the problem.\n- `Context`: Relevant documentation snippets that may aid in solving the problem.\n\nYour response must include:\n1.  **Reasoning**: A detailed, step-by-step thought process explaining how you arrived at the solution.\n    *   Analyze the user's `Query` to understand the problem and identify all `\/\/ TODO:` sections.\n    *   Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.\n    *   Leverage the `Hint` and `Context` (relevant documentation) to inform your solution. Explicitly reference concepts, syntax, or examples found in the `Context` that are applicable.\n    *   Explain *why* specific Cairo language constructs, patterns, or best practices are chosen (e.g., struct definition, struct instantiation, tuple\/struct destructuring, specific import paths).\n    *   Describe how each part of your proposed code addresses a specific `\/\/ TODO:` or test requirement.\n    *   Ensure your reasoning demonstrates a deep understanding of Cairo's ownership, mutability, and core language constructs as highlighted in the dataset description.\n2.  **Answer**: The complete, corrected Cairo code.\n    *   The code must be clean, idiomatic, and follow Cairo\/Starknet best practices.\n    *   It must compile successfully and be production-ready.\n    *   All `\/\/ TODO:` comments must be resolved and **removed**.\n    *   The `\/\/ I AM NOT DONE` marker must be **removed**.\n    *   Include *all necessary imports explicitly*. For `starknet::storage`, always use `use starknet::storage::*`. Do not include common `core` library imports (like `panic`, `println`) unless they are explicitly missing or required by the context.\n    *   If the task involves contract testing, adhere to the `important_rules` provided in the `test_template` context (full paths for core library imports, interface definition, and dispatcher import).\n\nYour overall goal is to provide a comprehensive and pedagogical solution, guiding the user through the fundamental Cairo concepts involved.",
