        "reasoning": "To add access control to public functions in a Cairo contract, the most common and recommended approach is to use the OpenZeppelin Cairo Contracts library. This library provides battle-tested implementations for various access control mechanisms.\n\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the need:** The user wants to restrict who can call certain public functions.\n2.  **Choose an access control mechanism:**\n    *   **Ownable:** This is the simplest form of access control, where only a single designated owner address can execute specific functions. It's suitable for contracts managed by a single entity.\n    *   **AccessControl:** This provides a more flexible, role-based access control system, allowing you to define different roles (e.g., `ADMIN_ROLE`, `MINTER_ROLE`) and grant\/revoke these roles to multiple addresses. This is suitable for more complex scenarios with multiple administrators or different permission levels.\n    For a general request like \"add access control,\" `Ownable` is a good starting point due to its simplicity. If more complex role management is needed, `AccessControl` would be the next step.\n3.  **Integrate OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract:**\n    *   **Dependency:** First, you'll need to add the OpenZeppelin Cairo Contracts as a dependency in your `Scarb.toml`.\n    *   **Component Usage:** In Cairo, OpenZeppelin contracts are typically integrated as components. You'll need to `use` the `OwnableComponent` and `derive` it for your contract.\n    *   **Initialization:** The `OwnableComponent` requires an `initializer` function to be called, typically in your contract's constructor, to set the initial owner.\n    *   **Restriction:** To restrict a function, you'll call `OwnableComponent::only_owner()` at the beginning of the function. This will revert the transaction if the caller is not the owner.\n4.  **Refactoring:** You will need to identify which of your existing public functions (`#[external]`) require access control and then add the `OwnableComponent::only_owner()` check to them. You'll also need to modify your contract's constructor to call the `OwnableComponent::initializer`.",

        "reasoning": "The user wants to implement an ERC20 token, which is a standard for fungible tokens on EVM-compatible chains, adapted for Starknet using Cairo. The request specifically includes minting and burning functionalities.\n\nTo fulfill this, the most efficient and secure approach is to leverage the OpenZeppelin Cairo Contracts library, which provides battle-tested implementations of standard tokens like ERC20.\n\nMy plan is:\n1.  **Identify the core component**: The `ERC20` contract from OpenZeppelin Cairo.\n2.  **Locate minting functionality**: OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` contract typically includes `_mint` and `_burn` internal functions that can be exposed via public functions with appropriate access control.\n3.  **Consider access control**: Minting and burning should generally be restricted to authorized entities (e.g., the contract deployer, or a specific 'minter' role). OpenZeppelin provides access control mechanisms like `Ownable` or `AccessControl` that can be integrated. The `ERC20` contract itself might have a `mint` function that is `only_owner` or similar.\n4.  **Cairo specifics**: Understand how to import and extend OpenZeppelin contracts in Cairo, and how to define public functions that call the internal `_mint` and `_burn` methods.\n\nTherefore, the search queries will focus on finding the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract, its mint\/burn methods, and how to use them in a Cairo project.",
