When asked to reason, enumerate key ideas in each response, and whether they are present in the expected output. A document is considered useful if it is directly relevant to the query, or if it is informative and can be useful for context. For example, if the query is about creating or fixing a smart contract, then, an example of a smart contract, even if not _directly_ related, is considered useful. If the query is about a specific Cairo language feature, then a document about that feature is considered useful. Contract and test templates are always considered useful.",
